    "# How to correct probabilities in NNs?,  By Brent Oeyen\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of oversampling or undersampling, the expected values of predicted probabilities by a Neural Network (NN) will no longer reflect the actual likelihood of events.\n",
    "For this reason, it is important to adjust the weights of events in case a bias exists in the training dataset. In the subsequent steps a straight forward example is provided how to eliminate a bias in the training dataset with respect to the probability of an event occurring.\n",
